# acorn-gitea
Acornfile for Gitea (experimental)

The goal of this repo is to have a working and interesting
Acornfile to deploy Gitea on Kubernetes. It is intended as
a learning repository, not a production release, and should
not be used in production without your own efforts at understanding
its use and hardening it to your production requirements.
